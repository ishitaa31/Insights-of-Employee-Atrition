Employee attrition impacts organizational productivity and costs. This project aims to predict attrition using HR data to enable proactive retention strategies. The report details data preprocessing, model selection, and performance analysis. Employee attrition has become a critical concern for organizations across industries due to its substantial impact on productivity, finances, and organizational knowledge. This project tackles this challenge by developing machine learning models to predict employee attrition using HR data, allowing for proactive retention interventions.

Abstract
This project predicts employee attrition using machine learning models. The IBM HR Analytics dataset was preprocessed, and five models were evaluated:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression achieved the highest performance with:

F1 Score: 0.4211
ROC AUC Score: 0.7707
Key Insights:
Overtime, Monthly Income, and Job Role significantly affect attrition.
The dataset was highly imbalanced and appropriate preprocessing was applied.
Feature importance helped in deriving impactful insights for HR departments.
